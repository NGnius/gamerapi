# GamerAPI
A Python library for asynchronously querying APIs for many games

Supported Games:
* Fortnite

## What?
GamerAPI is a library for retrieving player information with no fuss.
GamerAPI handles the API calls so you get objects instead of JSONs.
Objects are consistent between games, making multi-game apps easy.
Even if you don't need to access more than one game, GamerAPI makes game data easy.


##  Why?
Most games have APIs for retrieving player information and other useful information.
But every game implements their API in a different way.
This can lead to headaches and long nights.

GamerAPI aims to bring all of those game APIs together into a single unified library.
GamerAPI handles the differences between APIs so you can worry less about the data and more about your gamers.
